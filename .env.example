# Example .env.example — copy to .env and fill with real values (do NOT commit .env)
# App port

# Postgres connection details used by docker-compose service env
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_NAME=stankom

# DATABASE_URL is used by Prisma and the application when connecting directly.
# Format example for PostgreSQL (replace user/password/host/dbname as needed):
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/stankom?schema=public"

# Notes:
# - Copy this file to .env (gitignored) and update secrets.
# - If you run Prisma commands in CI or during Docker image build, ensure DATABASE_URL is
#   reachable or generated client is built in a stage that has access to it.
